# TODO LIST - PERFECT_CONSOLIDATED_BOT

## 🚀 NEW ROADMAP TO 10/10 (2025-08-13)

### ✅ Today - Completed
- [x] Fix DD percentage logging to use unified peak with non-negative guard; throttle logs
- [x] Make drawdown lock duration configurable; add `--drawdown-lock-sec` CLI flag
  - Test: `python newbotcode.py --smoke-test` and backtest run prints correct DD and countdown remaining

### 🎯 Phase 1: Full Kelly (Prob-Based Sizing) [~0.5h]
- [ ] Add `sympy` to requirements and import `sympy as sp`
- [ ] Compute Kelly fraction from win probability (ML if available; fallback 0.53)
- [ ] Integrate Kelly sizing into backtest and live entry sizing (guard to cap via `kelly_cap`)
- [ ] Acceptance: backtest runs; Sharpe increases ≥ +0.10 on 2022 set; no runtime errors
- Test: `python newbotcode.py --backtest xrp.csv --initial-capital=30`

### 🧠 Phase 2: Ensemble Voting (Consensus Signals) [~0.5h]
- [ ] Add simple TA companion (e.g., RSI or MACD/EMA) alongside ML
- [ ] Emit trade signal only on consensus BUY/SELL; otherwise HOLD (thresholds CLI-tunable)
- [ ] Acceptance: win rate +2–3% with fewer trades; logs show consensus rationale
- Test: same backtest; verify win rate increase

### ⚡ Phase 3: Vectorized TA (Speed) [~0.5h]
- [ ] Vectorize RSI/MACD/ATR in backtest using pandas/NumPy ops
- [ ] Acceptance: 5k hourly bars simulate < 1s locally; P&L unchanged vs scalar
- Test: time backtest before/after

### 💸 Phase 4: Live Tiers Fetch (Dynamic Fees) [~0.5h]
- [ ] Fetch user tier from Info.user_state; map to maker/taker bps dynamically
- [ ] Acceptance: fee rates in logs reflect tier; lower drag on higher volume paths
- Test: mock tier in backtest; observe fee changes in logs

### 🔒 Phase 5: Typing + Pytest Coverage [~1h]
- [ ] Add type hints to core APIs (ATR/RSI, PatternAnalyzer, fetchers)
- [ ] Create pytest suite (≥20 tests) including Kelly, ensemble, thresholds
- [ ] Acceptance: `pytest --maxfail=1` passes; optional `--cov` report ≥80%
- Test: `pip install -U pytest pytest-cov && pytest --cov`

### 🌐 Phase 6: Async Fetch (Performance) [~0.5h]
- [ ] Add aiohttp-based async downloader with robust fallback to sync
- [ ] Acceptance: download speed +50%; no blocking UI; fallback works on error
- Test: hourly backtest with `--download` faster and stable

### 📘 Phase 7: README and Dev UX [~0.5h]
- [ ] Create/update root README with setup, micro tips ($30), backtest/live examples
- [ ] Add `requirements.txt` (numpy, pandas, aiohttp, sympy, pytest, pytest-cov, etc.)
- [ ] Acceptance: new contributor can run backtest in 2 commands
- Test: fresh venv bootstrap and run example commands

### 🧪 Ongoing Validation
- [ ] Backtest harness: `--backtest --initial-capital=30 --hourly` per change
- [ ] Track: Sharpe > 1.6, MaxDD < 8%, Win% > 60% on $30 micro-account
