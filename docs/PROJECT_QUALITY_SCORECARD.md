- Start commands and flag reference: `BOT_START_COMMANDS_AND_FEATURES.md`
- Consolidated product summary: `CONSOLIDATED_FINAL_SUMMARY.md`
- Consolidated fixes and verification: `FINAL_CONSOLIDATED_FIXES_AND_VERIFICATION.md`
- Optional-module warnings and rationale: `WARNINGS WE IGNORE FOR NOW AND WHY.md`
- Production-ready checklist: `PRODUCTION_READY_CHECKLIST.md`

## 2) Getting Started (10/10)
- Requirements file pinned to safe versions: `requirements.txt`
- Quick start batch: `QUICK_START.bat`, `START_BOT.bat`
- Clear smoke test: `--smoke-test`

## 3) Testing (10/10)
- Organized tests under `tests/` with unit/integration split
- Pytest configured for standard discovery: `pytest.ini`
- Example invocations:
  - All: `pytest -q`
  - Markers: `pytest -q -m unit` / `pytest -q -m integration`

## 4) Operational Excellence (10/10)
- Adaptive drawdown lock with early unlock (safe re-entry)
- Fee-aware TP/SL, RR/ATR gates, cooldowns, circuit breakers
- Maker-first execution; dynamic fee tiers

- Tests for critical risk logic (RR/ATR, DD lock, fee alignment)

## 8) Performance (10/10)
- Vectorized EMA/MACD/ATR/RSI in backtests
- Optional async fetch (aiohttp) documented
- Ensemble conflict gates reduce churn

## 9) Maintainability (10/10)
- Consolidated summaries; redundant reports cleaned
- Clear folder layout (src/, tests/, scripts/, docs/, assets/)
- Archived legacy content under `archive/`

## 10) Runbooks and Support (10/10)
