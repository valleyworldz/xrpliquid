## 🧠 **QUANTUM ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS**

### **Multi-Ensemble Learning:**
```python
# Quantum-enhanced position sizing (working code from backtester)
if config.trading_mode == 'quantum_adaptive':
    base_signal_strength = min(abs(momentum / dynamic_edge), 4.0)
    trend_alignment = min(trend_strength / trend_strength_thresh, 2.0)
    regime_factor = 1.5 if vol24 < 0.1 else (1.2 if vol24 < 0.2 else 0.8)
    quantum_confidence = min((ml_score_long / 14.0) * 1.3, 1.5)
    
    signal_strength = base_signal_strength * trend_alignment * regime_factor * quantum_confidence
    size_mult = min(signal_strength * vol_adj, 3.0)  # Up to 3x quantum sizing
```

### **Adaptive Risk Management:**
```python
# Quantum profit taking - more aggressive for higher win rate
profit_threshold = stop_loss * max(0.05, eff_tp_mult * 0.2)

# Dynamic TP targets based on multiple factors
base_tp = 0.5 if trend_strength_now > (2.0 * trend_strength_thresh) else 0.3
vol_multiplier = 1.5 if current_vol < 0.01 else (1.2 if current_vol < 0.02 else 0.8)
persistence_mult = min(1.8, 1.0 + trend_persistence * 40)
quantum_factor = 1.0 + (net_pnl / stop_loss) * 0.3
```

### **ML Signal Filtering:**
```python
# Quantum-adaptive ML threshold for A.I. ULTIMATE
ml_threshold = 7  # More permissive than standard 10

# Advanced feature scoring (max 14 points)
if breakout_ok_long: ml_score_long += 3
if momentum > dynamic_edge and dir_agree >= 2: ml_score_long += 3
if trend_up and trend_strength > ts_thresh: ml_score_long += 2
if ema_pullback_long or long_on_trend: ml_score_long += 2
if adx_ok and z_ok_long: ml_score_long += 2
# ... additional quantum features
```
