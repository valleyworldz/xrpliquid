## üõ†Ô∏è **IMPLEMENTED OPTIMIZATION FEATURES**

### **1. DYNAMIC LEVERAGE SCALING**
```python
# Base leverage by account size
if account_value <= 100: base_leverage = 2.0
elif account_value <= 500: base_leverage = 3.0
elif account_value <= 2000: base_leverage = 4.0
else: base_leverage = 5.0

# Market regime adjustments
regime_multiplier = {
    'bull': 1.2,      # Increase leverage in bull markets
    'bear': 0.6,      # Reduce leverage in bear markets
    'volatile': 0.7,  # Reduce leverage in volatile markets
    'neutral': 1.0    # No adjustment in neutral markets
}
```

### **2. KELLY CRITERION POSITION SIZING**
```python
# Kelly criterion for optimal position sizing
kelly_fraction = (win_rate * avg_win - (1 - win_rate) * avg_loss) / avg_win
kelly_fraction = max(0.0, min(kelly_fraction, 0.25))  # Cap at 25%

# Regime adjustments
regime_adjustment = {
    'bull': 1.2,      # Increase size in bull markets
    'bear': 0.7,      # Reduce size in bear markets
    'volatile': 0.8,  # Reduce size in volatile markets
    'neutral': 1.0    # No adjustment
}
```

### **3. MARKET REGIME DETECTION**
```python
# Regime classification based on multiple factors

    market_regime = "bull"
elif short_trend < -0.02 and medium_trend < -0.01 and volume_trend > 0.1:
    market_regime = "bear"
elif volatility > volatility_ma * 1.5:
    market_regime = "volatile"
else:
    market_regime = "neutral"
```

### **4. MULTI-ASSET PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION**
```python
# Select assets with correlation limits
max_correlation = 0.7  # Maximum correlation between assets
max_total_allocation = 0.8  # Maximum 80% total allocation

# Performance-based allocation
allocation = min(0.3, score * 0.2)  # Maximum 30% per asset
```

### **5. ADAPTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT**
```python
# Performance-based risk adjustment
if win_rate > 0.6 and profit_factor > 1.5:
    performance_multiplier = 1.1  # Increase risk when performing well
elif win_rate < 0.4 or profit_factor < 0.8:
    performance_multiplier = 0.7  # Reduce risk when performing poorly

# Market regime risk adjustment
regime_risk_multiplier = {
    'bull': 1.1,      # Slightly increase risk in bull markets
    'bear': 0.7,      # Reduce risk in bear markets
    'volatile': 0.6,  # Significantly reduce risk in volatile markets
    'neutral': 1.0    # No adjustment
