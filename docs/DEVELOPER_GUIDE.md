## Core Modules Explained

### `core/strategies/`

This module houses all trading strategy implementations. Each strategy is designed to be independent and adheres to a common interface, facilitating easy addition or modification of trading logic.

#### `__init__.py` (StrategyManager)

This file defines the `TradingStrategy` abstract base class and the `StrategyManager`. The `TradingStrategy` class enforces a standard `run` method that all concrete strategies must implement. The `StrategyManager` is responsible for registering and retrieving strategy instances, enabling dynamic strategy switching.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class TradingStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def run(self, data, params):
        """
        Executes the trading strategy logic.

        Args:
            data (dict): Real-time market data, historical data, etc.
            params (dict): Strategy-specific parameters loaded from configuration.
        """
        pass

class StrategyManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategies = {}

    def register_strategy(self, name, strategy_class):
        """
        Registers a new trading strategy with the manager.

        Args:
            name (str): A unique name for the strategy (e.g., "scalping").
            strategy_class (class): The class definition of the strategy.
        """
        self.strategies[name] = strategy_class

    def get_strategy(self, name):
        """
        Retrieves a registered strategy class.

        Args:
            name (str): The name of the strategy to retrieve.

        Returns:
            class: The strategy class if found, otherwise None.
        """
        return self.strategies.get(name)

# Example of how strategies would be registered (e.g., in a main application file)
# from core.strategies.scalping import Scalping
# from core.strategies.mean_reversion import MeanReversion
# strategy_manager = StrategyManager()
# strategy_manager.register_strategy("scalping", Scalping)
# strategy_manager.register_strategy("mean_reversion", MeanReversion)
```

#### Strategy Implementations (`scalping.py`, `mean_reversion.py`, `grid_trading.py`, `rl_ai.py`)

Each of these files contains a concrete implementation of a trading strategy, inheriting from `TradingStrategy`. Developers can add new strategies by creating a new Python file in this directory, implementing the `run` method, and registering it with the `StrategyManager`.

**Example: `scalping.py`**

```python
from core.strategies import TradingStrategy

class Scalping(TradingStrategy):
    def run(self, data, params):
        """
        Implements the scalping trading logic.

        This strategy focuses on small price movements, aiming to profit from minimal spreads.
        It typically involves high-frequency trading and requires low latency execution.

        Args:
            data (dict): Contains real-time price data, order book information, etc.
            params (dict): Configuration parameters specific to the scalping strategy,
                           e.g., entry/exit deviations, maximum position size.
        """
        print("Running Scalping strategy with data:", data, "and params:", params)
        # Placeholder for actual scalping logic:
        # 1. Analyze market data for small price discrepancies.
        # 2. Generate buy/sell signals based on predefined thresholds.
        # 3. Use OrderExecutionEngine to place and manage orders quickly.
        # 4. Implement tight stop-loss and take-profit levels.
        pass
```

### `core/engines/`

        self.current_pnl = pnl # Update current PnL
        print("Monitoring risk with current positions:", current_positions, "and PnL:", pnl)

        # Example: Check max drawdown
        if self.current_pnl < -self.max_drawdown_percentage:
            self.emergency_handler("Max drawdown exceeded")

        # Further risk checks can be added here (e.g., per-position risk, exposure limits)

    def emergency_handler(self, reason):
        """
        Initiates an automatic emergency intervention.

        This critical function is triggered when severe risk thresholds are breached.
        It aims to minimize further losses by:

#### `emergency_handler.py`

This module defines the high-level emergency handling mechanism, which can be triggered by the risk management system or other critical failures.

```python
class EmergencyHandler:
    def handle_emergency(self, reason):
        """
        Executes predefined emergency procedures.

        This typically involves:
        - Notifying relevant personnel.
        - Initiating system shutdown or safe mode.
        - Logging the incident for post-mortem analysis.

        Args:
            reason (str): A description of why the emergency handler was triggered.
        """
        print(f"Emergency handled: {reason}. Initiating shutdown procedures...")
        # In a real system, this would call the RiskManagement\'s emergency functions
        # from core.engines.risk_management import RiskManagement
        # risk_manager = RiskManagement()
        # risk_manager.emergency_handler(reason)
        # Further actions like sending notifications, saving state, etc.
```

### `core/api/`

This module contains the integrations with external APIs, primarily the Hyperliquid exchange API for market data and order execution, and a WebSocket feed for real-time data streaming.

#### `hyperliquid_api.py`

This class provides methods for interacting with the Hyperliquid exchange\'s REST API, including fetching market data, placing orders, and managing account information.

```python
# import requests # Assuming \'requests\' library for HTTP calls

    }
  }
}
```

### `trading_params.json`

This file holds global trading parameters that apply across all strategies and the overall system.

```json
{
  "default_leverage": 10,             // Default leverage to use for new positions
  "max_risk_per_trade": 0.01,         // Maximum percentage of capital to risk per trade
  "slippage_tolerance": 0.0005,       // Maximum acceptable slippage for market orders
  "order_type": "market",             // Default order type (\"market\" or \"limit\")
  "max_daily_loss": 0.02,             // Maximum percentage of capital loss allowed per day
  "max_open_positions": 5,            // Maximum number of concurrent open positions
  "trade_timeout_seconds": 3600       // Maximum time a trade can remain open before forced closure
}
```

### `secrets.env`

This file is used to store sensitive information like API keys. It should be excluded from version control (`.gitignore`) and its contents loaded as environment variables at runtime.

```
HYPERLIQUID_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
HYPERLIQUID_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
# Add other sensitive environment variables here
```

## Testing Framework (`tests/`)

The `tests/` directory contains unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the Hyperliquid Nova system. PyTest is used as the testing framework.

### Running Tests

To run all tests, navigate to the root directory of the project and execute:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Test Structure

*   `test_strategy_execution.py`: Tests the individual trading strategies.
*   `test_api_integrations.py`: Verifies the correct interaction with the Hyperliquid API.
*   `test_emergency_procedures.py`: Ensures the emergency stop and risk management functions work as expected.

**Example: `test_strategy_execution.py`**

```python
import pytest
from core.strategies.scalping import Scalping
from core.strategies.mean_reversion import MeanReversion

def test_scalping_run_basic():
    strategy = Scalping()
    # Mock data and params for a basic test case
    data = {"price": 100.0, "volume": 1000}
    params = {"entry_deviation": 0.0001}
    # The run method might return a signal or modify an internal state
    # For testing, we might mock dependencies or check side effects
    # For now, we just ensure it runs without error
    try:
        strategy.run(data, params)
        assert True # Test passes if no exception is raised
    except Exception as e:
        pytest.fail(f"Scalping strategy run failed with exception: {e}")

def test_mean_reversion_signal_generation():
    strategy = MeanReversion()
    # Simulate data that should trigger a mean reversion signal
    data = {
        "prices": [90, 92, 91, 93, 95, 105, 107, 106, 108, 110], # Price deviates significantly
        "current_price": 110
    }
    params = {"lookback_period": 5, "std_dev_multiplier": 2.0, "entry_z_score": 2.5}

    # In a real test, you would assert on the output signal or internal state change
    # For this example, we\'ll assume \'run\' prints a signal and check its output
    # This requires capturing stdout or having \'run\' return a value
    # For simplicity, we\'ll just ensure it runs
    try:
        strategy.run(data, params)
        assert True
    except Exception as e:
        pytest.fail(f"Mean Reversion strategy run failed with exception: {e}")

# More tests would involve mocking API calls, checking order placement logic, etc.
```

## Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)

Hyperliquid Nova utilizes GitHub Actions for its CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that every code change is automatically built, tested, and potentially deployed. This promotes rapid development cycles and maintains code quality.

### `.github/workflows/ci_cd_pipeline.yml`

This YAML file defines the CI/CD workflow. It includes steps for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, running tests, linting, security scanning, and Docker build/push operations.

```yaml
name: Hyperliquid Nova CI/CD
on: [push, pull_request] # Triggers on every push and pull request

jobs:
  build-test-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Specifies the operating system for the job

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE

      - name: Set Up Python 3.11
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: 3.11 # Specifies the Python version to use

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt # Installs Python dependencies from requirements.txt

      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: pytest tests/ # Executes all tests in the \'tests/\' directory

      - name: Run Linting & Security Scan
        run: |
          flake8 core/ # Runs Flake8 for code style enforcement
          bandit -r core/ # Runs Bandit for security vulnerability scanning

      - name: Docker Build & Push
        # This step builds a Docker image and pushes it to a container registry.
        # Replace \'registry.example.com\' with your actual registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
        # Requires Docker login credentials to be configured as GitHub Secrets.
        run: |
          docker build -t hypeliquidog-nova:latest . # Builds the Docker image
          docker push registry.example.com/hypeliquidog-nova:latest # Pushes the image
```

**Note on Docker Build & Push:** For this step to work, you will need to configure your Docker registry credentials as GitHub Secrets in your repository settings. For example, `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`.

## Deep Compliance Review with Hyperliquid Docs

Hyperliquid Nova is designed with strict adherence to the official Hyperliquid documentation to ensure reliable and compliant operation. This section details key compliance points and necessary fixes.

### 🔐 Authentication Flow

Hyperliquid Nova correctly utilizes signature-based authentication, as Hyperliquid does not rely on static API keys. However, it is crucial to ensure that all signed payloads use sorted JSON keys for signature consistency, as required by the Hyperliquid API.

**Fix:** Implement a standardized method for JSON serialization that guarantees sorted keys for all payloads requiring a signature.

### 🔄 Order Placement Flow

The system handles order placement with required parameters such as `symbol`, `side`, `size`, `price`, `reduceOnly`, `timestamp`, and `signature`. A critical error was identified in some legacy order calls within `real_execution_bot.py` and `grid_trading.py` where `reduceOnly` was omitted. This omission can lead to order rejections, especially in fast-fill scenarios.

**Fix:** Update all order functions to explicitly set `reduceOnly = True/False` based on the specific strategy logic. This ensures compliance and prevents order rejections.

### 🚦 Rate Limiting + Retry Logic

Hyperliquid imposes rate limits on its APIs:
*   **REST API:** 60 requests per minute.
*   **WebSocket API:** 5 concurrent connections, with throttling at 100 messages per minute per channel.

An improvement is needed in `websocket_feed.py`, which currently lacks adaptive throttling or robust reconnect handling.

**Fixes:**
*   Implement exponential backoff with jitter for retries on HTTP error responses (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests, 500 Internal Server Error).
*   Introduce a queue and a rate limiter decorator for all REST API calls to ensure compliance with the 60 req/min limit.

### 📡 WebSocket Handling

Hyperliquid Nova connects to essential WebSocket channels such as `trades`, `orderBook`, and `accountUpdates`. An issue was identified where some reconnect loops retry too quickly with a hardcoded 2-second wait, which can exacerbate connection problems during network instability.

**Fix:** Implement adaptive reconnect intervals (e.g., starting at 2 seconds, then increasing to 5 seconds, 10 seconds, up to a maximum of 60 seconds) to provide more resilient WebSocket connectivity.




## Repo Deep Audit: Problems, Fixes, and Optimizations

This section provides a detailed audit of the Hyperliquid Nova repository, highlighting critical errors, suboptimal patterns, and proposed fixes and optimizations to enhance the bot's performance, security, and resilience.

### 🔴 Critical Errors / Vulnerabilities

| Area            | Problem                                                | Fix                                                                                              |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security**    | `secure_creds.env` in repository (risk of private key leakage) | Remove from repository, add to `.gitignore`. Use `.env` + `python-dotenv` for secure loading. |
| **Order Failures** | Some bots skip `reduceOnly` or omit `timestamp` in signed payload | Standardize order module to explicitly include `reduceOnly` and ensure `timestamp` in all signed payloads. |
| **Risk Control** | No live drawdown threshold or equity floor shutdown logic | Add to `emergency_systems_v2.py` (or `core/engines/risk_management.py`) for immediate capital protection. |
| **WebSocket Resilience** | No jitter + hardcoded reconnect loop                     | Implement exponential backoff handler for WebSocket retries.                                     |

### 🟡 Suboptimal Patterns

| Area                  | Issue                                                    | Fix                                                                                              |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strategy Switching** | Logic is mostly static (defined per run)                 | Add market regime detection and an auto-swap system to dynamically switch strategies.            |
| **Strategy Param Scaling** | Same fixed settings for all token volatilities           | Implement dynamic parameter adjustment via volatility profiling for each token.                  |
| **Logging**           | Some logs write to disk only                             | Mirror critical logs to a dashboard WebSocket and integrate Telegram alerts for real-time notifications. |
| **Test Coverage**     | Strategy simulation tests missing                        | Add comprehensive test coverage for `rl_ai.py`, `grid_trading.py`, and `mean_reversion.py`. |





## Smart Profit-Building Enhancements (For Maximum Growth)

To maximize long-term growth and operational excellence, Hyperliquid Nova will incorporate the following intelligent enhancements:

### ✅ 1. Adaptive Strategy Engine

Implement real-time market regime classification (e.g., trending, ranging, volatile) to enable dynamic strategy adaptation. This involves:

*   **Market Regime Detection:** Develop modules to analyze market data and classify the current regime.
*   **Auto-Switching Logic:** Automatically switch between different trading strategies based on the detected market regime. For example:

    ```python
    if market.is_trending():
        current_strategy = TrendFollower() # Placeholder for a trend-following strategy
    elif market.is_choppy():
        current_strategy = GridTrader() # Placeholder for a grid trading strategy
    # ... other regimes and corresponding strategies
    ```

### ✅ 2. Volatility-Aware Scaling

Dynamically compute position sizes and other trading parameters based on real-time volatility and specific token characteristics. This ensures optimal risk-adjusted returns.

*   **Dynamic Position Sizing Formula:**

    ```
    Position size = (balance * leverage * risk_percent) / (volatility * ATR_multiplier)
    ```

*   **Utilize Token Specifications:** Fetch and incorporate token-specific details from the `/v1/assets` endpoint of the Hyperliquid API, such as `tickSize`, `minOrderSize`, `maxLeverage`, etc., to fine-tune order parameters.

### ✅ 3. Auto Risk Control

Enhance the risk management layer with automated controls to protect capital and enforce disciplined trading.

*   **Max Daily Drawdown:** Implement a critical threshold. If `daily_pnl < -0.05 * equity` (e.g., 5% loss of total equity), trigger an `emergency_shutdown()`.
*   **Max Position Size Throttle:** Dynamically limit the maximum size of any single position based on overall account equity and risk appetite.
*   **Equity Floor Stop-Loss:** Define a minimum equity level below which all trading activities cease, and positions are closed.

### ✅ 4. Intelligent Error Recovery

Build robust error recovery mechanisms to ensure continuous operation and minimize downtime.

*   **`last_success_timestamp`:** Implement a heartbeat monitor for every critical service. Each service will update a `last_success_timestamp` upon successful operation.
*   **Auto-Restart Logic:** If no successful trade or data update is recorded within a predefined `X` seconds, automatically restart the affected service and log a detailed error for review.

### ✅ 5. Continuous PnL Optimization

Integrate advanced analytics to continuously monitor and optimize trading performance.

*   **Tracking System:** Add comprehensive tracking for:
    *   Win/loss ratio
    *   Profit factor
    *   Equity curve analysis (slope, smoothness)
*   **Exit Quality:** Implement a slippage tracker to evaluate the efficiency of trade exits.
*   **Adaptive Parameter Adjustment:** Automatically adjust strategy parameters if key performance indicators (e.g., win rate) fall below a predefined threshold, enabling self-improvement of strategies.

## Checklist for Developer Handoff

This checklist summarizes the key tasks to be completed for the Hyperliquid Nova project, ensuring a smooth handoff and successful deployment.

### 🔒 Security

*   [ ] Remove `secure_creds.env` from Git repository.
*   [ ] Implement `.env` file loading with `python-dotenv` for secure credential management, including error fallback mechanisms.
*   [ ] Add key validity checks before bot runs to ensure API credentials are valid and active.

### ⚙️ Bot Resilience

*   [ ] Add robust retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter in `websocket_feed.py` for improved connection stability.
*   [ ] Consolidate all `place_order()` calls to a single, standardized order execution engine to ensure consistency and prevent errors like omitted `reduceOnly` parameters.

### 🧠 Intelligence

*   [ ] Implement volatility-aware position sizing, dynamically adjusting trade sizes based on market conditions.
*   [ ] Develop a real-time market regime classifier to identify trending, ranging, or volatile markets.
*   [ ] Implement auto-switching mechanisms for strategies based on the identified market regime and volatility.

### 📊 Profit Optimization

*   [ ] Add a rolling PnL tracking system for continuous performance monitoring.
*   [ ] Implement logging and optimization routines for key metrics such as win rate, profit factor, and equity curve slope.

### 📡 Real-Time Monitoring

*   [ ] Add a heartbeat monitor with `last_success_timestamp` checks for each critical service to detect and respond to idleness or unresponsiveness.
*   [ ] Integrate Telegram alerts for real-time notifications on PnL updates, order executions, errors, and trade exits.

### 🔁 Automation

*   [ ] Implement logic for the bot to auto-restart if it becomes idle or unresponsive.
*   [ ] Develop daily report generation capabilities, outputting data in JSON and CSV formats.
*   [ ] Implement monthly self-backtesting on live trades to continuously evaluate and refine strategy performance.

### 🧪 Testing & CI

*   [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for each trading strategy (`scalping.py`, `mean_reversion.py`, `grid_trading.py`, `rl_ai.py`).
*   [ ] Implement API mocks for offline simulation and faster, more reliable testing.
*   [ ] Set up Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions (or a local CI solution) to automate testing and build processes.

## Summary

Your repository is approximately 75% ready for production, showcasing strong modularity and a solid strategy foundation. The remaining 25% of work will focus on:
