## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Engine Initialization
```python
# High-performance engine components loaded successfully
if ENGINE_IMPORTS_AVAILABLE:
    self.risk_engine = RealTimeRiskEngine(logger=self.logger)
    self.observability_engine = ObservabilityEngine(logger=self.logger)
```

2. **Risk Metrics**: Monitor drawdown, portfolio value, and exposure
3. **System Metrics**: Performance, latency, and error rate tracking
4. **Predictive Alerts**: Anomaly detection and failure prediction

## 🛡️ Risk Management Enhancements

### Kill-Switch Configuration
```python
kill_switches = {
    'drawdown_kill': 5% threshold,      # Stop trading at 5% drawdown
    'position_loss_kill': 2% threshold, # Close positions at 2% loss
    'daily_loss_kill': 10% threshold,   # Stop trading at 10% daily loss
    'emergency_kill': 15% threshold,    # Emergency shutdown at 15% loss
    'leverage_kill': 5x threshold,      # Reduce positions at 5x leverage
    'margin_kill': 1.2x threshold       # Close positions below 1.2x margin
}
```

### Risk Limits
- **Max Drawdown**: 5% (reduced from 10%)
- **Max Position Loss**: 2% per position
- **Max Daily Loss**: 10% per day
