        - "volatile": High price fluctuations without clear direction.

        # Placeholder for actual market regime analysis logic.
        # In a real-world scenario, this would involve:
        # 1. Calculating indicators like ADX for trend strength, Bollinger Bands for volatility.
        # 2. Applying machine learning models trained on historical regime data.
        # 3. Using statistical methods to identify patterns.

        # For demonstration, a simplified logic:
        price_change = data.get("price_change", 0) # Assume price_change is provided in data
        volatility = data.get("volatility", 0) # Assume volatility is provided in data

        if abs(price_change) > 0.02 and volatility > 0.01: # Significant price change and high volatility

        elif volatility > 0.005 and abs(price_change) < 0.005: # Moderate volatility, small price change
            return "ranging"
